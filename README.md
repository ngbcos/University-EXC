# Extreme Computing

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Extreme Computing](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/exc/) course, taken in 2011/2012. There were two pieces of coursework during the CAV course: the first was an essay on cloud infrastructure, specifically a fictional company providing personal computation 'as a service', while the second coursework involved using MapReduce (on the Hadoop infrastructure) to solve problems.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.

## Coursework Mark ##

70-100% (from memory)

## Known Errors ##

There are some likely bugs in the MapReduce side of the coursework, most probably in the Java implementation.
