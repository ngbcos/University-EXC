the

at

five

for

in

to
return
to

it

the

said
the

plan
announced
by
Eu
leaders
on
26
October
had
been
an
important

but
the
measures
must
be

the
Oecd
s
message
to
world
leaders
came
as
it
predicted
a
sharp
slowdown
in

in
the
eurozone

warned
that
some
countries
in
the

bloc
were
likely
to

the
Ilo
said
a
stalled
global
economic
recovery
had
begun
to
dramatically
affect
labour
markets
it
said
approximately
80
million
net
new
jobs
would
be
needed
over
the
next
two
years
to
get
back
to
Pre-crisis

but
it
said
the
recent
slowdown
in
growth
suggested
that
only
half
the

needed
would
be
created

the

also
measured
levels

the
